# Nodebots training

## Description

With this training, you'll learn how to program for Arduino using Node.js and the johnny-five library. 

## With this training, you will learn

* How to wire together circuit components and an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)
* How to use [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) to control components in a circuit
* How to expose your hardware to the wider internet using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and websockets

## Preparations for this training

In order to prepare for this training you should do the following workshopper exercises. If you have questions, please open an issue and we will be glad to answer, you might be helping other participants too.

### Nodebot Workshop

The nodebot workshop is a [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) workshopper built especially for LXJS.

Learn the basics of the johnny-five api, as a series of code challenges.

johnny-five is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.

The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a node program.

Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see you solution run for real.

#### Getting started

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Install [node-gyp dependencies for your system](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation)
3. Install the nodebot workshop: `npm install -g nodebot-workshop`
4. Start the workshopper: `nodebot-workshop`
5. Select an exercise, read the instructions and code your solution
6. Check your solution: `nodebot-workshop verify your-solution.js`
7. Run your solution: plug in your Ardunio and type `node your-solution.js`

#### Materials

No materials are required for the workshopper, but if you want to build your circuits and see your code running for real then get your hands on one of these:

* [Sparkfun Inventor Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001)
* [Arduino Starter Kit ARDX](http://oomlout.co.uk/collections/arduino/products/arduino-starter-kit-ardx)
* [Proto-PIC Arduino Starter Kit](http://proto-pic.co.uk/proto-pic-arduino-starter-kit-for-arduino-uno/)
